      <p class="info">Software Engineer | Student</p>
      <p>
        I am currently a computer science student at the University of Ottawa
        and expect to graduate in 2026. My interests include machine learning
        and web development. I am also part of the University of Ottawa's Mars
        Rover Team.
      </p>

        My most recent position was as a software developer at Knowtech
        Solutions where I created a system to collect, clean and transform data
        from tweets matching keywords from Twitter using Python. I also
        implemented and tested Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and BERT
        models to classify tweets inducing human trafficking. Finally, I created
        a command line tool to manually label tweets for training the models,
        and communicated with and prepared demos of my work for my supervisor.
      </p>

        I also previously worked as software developer at Digitera Interactive
        where I worked in a team of 3 to create webscrapers to collect data from
        various sites including Instagram. We collected and saved the data in
        CSV or JSON format and also created demos of our work.
