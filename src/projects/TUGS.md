TUGS: The Ultimate Graduation Slideshow. A full stack web application intended for highschool students and admins to create, read, update and delete graduation related information. Entered student information can then be presented as a web-based slideshow.

The backend consists of PHP generated pages, and a MySQL database, which includes multiple tables storing data related to login credentials, individual student data, event logs, etc.

The front end was built using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Bootstrap was also used for theming.
