A full stack web app that allows a user to create, read and delete goals.

The frontend uses React and Redux, while the backend uses Express and MongoDB. Client side routing is done using React Router. The usage of an external MongoDB database allows for data persistence across sessions.

A user is allowed to login or register for an account using an email and password. Authentication is performed using JWT tokens.
